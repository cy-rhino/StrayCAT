The design CAD is CircuitStudio. Board dimensions and hole locations are Raspberry Pi compliant, but other component placement is original and not mechanically compatible with any product.

The pattern width of the differential lines is 6.929 mils and the spacing is 5.41 mils, designed to have an impedance of 100-Ohm when the board is manufactured to standard PCBGOGO specifications.
