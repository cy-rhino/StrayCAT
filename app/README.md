# StrayCAT ESI Tool
 ESI .xml file generator

![Image](../img/StrayCAT_ESI_Tool.png)

This tool is developed in VB.NET. It has only one form and the source code is written in a concise manner. The parameters that cannot be set in the form are hard-coded, so they can be easily modified using Visual Studio.

Originally, the ability to export binary files is also necessary, but I do not plan to implement this feature because I do not have the necessary knowledge.

This tool has not yet been fully tested. Users must check the generated xml and correct any problems they find.
